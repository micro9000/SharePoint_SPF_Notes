# Hello World Project

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/build-a-hello-world-web-part#web-part-class

HelloWorldWebPart.ts in the src\webparts\helloworld folder defines the main entry point for the web part. The web part class HelloWorldWebPart extends the BaseClientSideWebPart. Any client-side web part should extend the BaseClientSideWebPart class to be defined as a valid web part.

BaseClientSideWebPart implements the minimal functionality that is required to build a web part. This class also provides many parameters to validate and access read-only properties such as displayMode, web part properties, web part context, web part instanceId, the web part domElement, and much more.
