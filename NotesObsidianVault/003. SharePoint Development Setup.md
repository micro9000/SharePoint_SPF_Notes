# SharePoint Development Setup

1. Create Site Collection
   - Go to SharePoint Admin Center
   - Sites -> Active Sites -> Create Communication Site
2. Download and install SharePoint Online Management Shell (PowerShell module) - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online
3. Create SharePoint App Catalog

Note: App Catalog are now under Site Collection. The Tenant level App Catalog are now deprecated. Microsoft is now recommending to create App Catalog at Site Collection level.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell

Connect-SPOService -Url https://87t1zf-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential admin@contoso.com

# Create Site Collection's App Catalog
# this will create new App Catalog named "Apps for SharePoint" list in the site collection (go to Site contents of your site collection)

Add-SPOSiteCollectionAppCatalog -Site "https://87t1zf.sharepoint.com/sites/SPFxTrainingSite"
```

Info: App Catalog is the location where we store our SPFx solution

Side note:

When I open the "Apps for SharePoint" App catalog, there was a warning at the top of the page saying
