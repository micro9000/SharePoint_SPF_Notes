Field customizers can be used to change the default rending logic of a field in SharePoint lists or libraries using JavaScript. They enable complex rendering options of the value – for example showing graphical presentation of the field value rather than simply rendering the numeric value of the field.

Field customizers are only supported in the read-only mode, which means that you cannot override the editing experience of the field with it.

Here’s an example image with the field customizer rendering
