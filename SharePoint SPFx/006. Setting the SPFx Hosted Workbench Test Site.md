# Setting the SharePoint Framework Hosted Workbench Test Site

## Improving the SPFx development test & debugging experience

Starting with SPFx v1.17, Microsoft replaced the hosted workbench URL launched when you execute gulp serve with a dynamic value. This is defined in the project’s ./config/serve.json file in the initialPage property:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/spfx-build/spfx-serve.schema.json",
  "port": 4321,
  "https": true,
  "initialPage": "https://{tenantDomain}/_layouts/workbench.aspx"
}
```

Notice the {tenantDomain} string? The SPFx build toolchain will replace this value on the fly with a value defined in an environment variable on your local workstation.

Developers can use the SPFX_SERVE_TENANT_DOMAIN OS environment variable to specify the tenant domain (or site URL) for serve configurations across different SPFx solutions. If a URL in the serve configuration (for example, pageUrl for Field Customizer) contains the {tenantDomain} placeholder, it will be automatically replaced with the variable’s value.

But if this environment variable isn’t set, the link won’t work. Refer back to the image above… notice the line in the console that says it’s opening the URL in the browser that still has the {tenantDomain} placeholder:

Opening https://{tenantDomain}/\_layouts/workbench.aspx using the default OS app
Clearly, that won’t work. That indicates the environment variable isn’t set in my test.
