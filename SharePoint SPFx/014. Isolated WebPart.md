### Retiring SharePoint Framework domain isolated web parts for SharePoint Online

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/isolated-web-parts-retirement

After careful consideration and extensive review of usage data and feedback we’ve decided to announce the retirement of the domain isolated web parts feature in SharePoint Framework (SPFx). As of April 2nd, 2026 domain isolated web parts will be fully retired and stop working for existing tenants. If tenants are still using domain isolated web parts then they’ll see the web part render and error message and stop functioning. New tenants onboarding from April 2nd, 2025 will not be able to use domain isolated web parts. This applies to all environments including Government Clouds and Department of Defense. There will not be an option to extend domain isolated web parts beyond April 2, 2026.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we believe this is the best decision for the future of SPFx and SharePoint.
