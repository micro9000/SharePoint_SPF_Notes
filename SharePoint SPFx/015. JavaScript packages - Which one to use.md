In SPFx development which one should I use for CRUD operations for SharePoint Lists, documents, and other sharepoint storages? npm packages - @microsoft/sp-http - @pnp/sp - PnP/PnP.js

###### ChatGPT said:

Great question! When working with **CRUD operations on SharePoint Lists, Documents, and other SharePoint storage** in **SPFx development**, the recommended choice is:

---

## ‚úÖ **Use `@pnp/sp` (PnPjs)**

### Why?

- It offers a **fluent, strongly-typed, and intuitive API** for working with SharePoint.
    
- It's built **on top of `@microsoft/sp-http`**, so it integrates cleanly with SPFx.
    
- Handles things like:
    
    - Lists and list items (CRUD)
        
    - Document libraries
        
    - Files and folders
        
    - Content types, fields, etc.
        
    - User profiles and groups
        
- Works well with the **SPFx context** for proper auth and headers.

## üö´ **Avoid using `PnP/PnP.js` (the old version)**

- This is the **legacy PnP JS Core library** (deprecated).
    
- It‚Äôs not recommended for new projects.
    
- `@pnp/sp` is its modern, modular, TypeScript-friendly replacement.

## üõ†Ô∏è When to use `@microsoft/sp-http`

- Use it if you're doing **low-level HTTP calls** manually.
    
- Required when:
    
    - You‚Äôre using `MSGraphClient` or `AadHttpClient`.
        
    - You want full control over `fetch` requests to SharePoint or Graph.
        
- Not very developer-friendly for complex SharePoint operations ‚Äî **you‚Äôll write a lot more boilerplate** code.

## ‚úÖ Recommended Setup in SPFx

bash

CopyEdit

`npm install @pnp/sp @pnp/logging @pnp/common @pnp/odata`

Then initialize it in your SPFx component:

ts

CopyEdit

`import { sp } from "@pnp/sp"; import "@pnp/sp/webs"; import "@pnp/sp/lists"; import "@pnp/sp/items";  sp.setup({   spfxContext: this.context });`

### Example: Create a list item

ts

CopyEdit

`await sp.web.lists.getByTitle("My List").items.add({   Title: "Hello world" });`

## üî• Summary

|Package|Use for|Recommended|
|---|---|---|
|`@pnp/sp`|High-level CRUD for lists, docs, etc.|‚úÖ Yes|
|`@microsoft/sp-http`|Low-level HTTP + Graph integration|‚ö†Ô∏è Limited|
|`PnP/PnP.js`|Legacy, avoid in new projects|‚ùå No|

Let me know if you want a PnP setup template or CRUD sample for a SharePoint list!
