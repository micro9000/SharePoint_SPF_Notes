The easiest way, to connect to anonymous APIs in your SharePoint Framework solutions, is by using the HttpClient provided as a part of the SharePoint Framework. For example, to get dummy information from the Typicode service, you would execute:

TypeScriptCopy

```
this.context.httpClient
  .get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1', HttpClient.configurations.v1)
  .then((res: HttpClientResponse): Promise<any> => {
    return res.json();
  })
  .then((response: any): void => {
    console.log(response);
  });
```

Similarly to the **SPHttpClient** you use for connecting to SharePoint APIs, the **HttpClient** offers you similar capabilities for running the most common web requests. If necessary, you can use its options, to configure requests.

For example, to specify request headers, you would use the following code:

TypeScriptCopy

```
this.context.httpClient
  .get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1', HttpClient.configurations.v1,
    {
      headers: [
        ['accept', 'application/json']
      ]
    })
  .then((res: HttpClientResponse): Promise<any> => {
    return res.json();
  })
  .then((response: any): void => {
    console.log(response);
  });
```

### Considerations for using the HttpClient

When using the **HttpClient**, there are a few things that you should take into account.

#### Authentication cookies not included

While the **HttpClient** is similar to the **SPHttpClient**, it doesn't include authentication cookies in its requests. So if you were to use it to connect to SharePoint APIs, your requests would fail with a 401 Unauthorized response.

#### Part of the SharePoint Framework

The **HttpClient** is part of the SharePoint Framework and you don't need any additional dependencies to start using it. It is already available on the page that is why using it doesn't cause additional performance overhead on runtime.
