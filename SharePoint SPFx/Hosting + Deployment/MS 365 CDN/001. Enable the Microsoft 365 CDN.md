# Enable the Microsoft 365 CDN

You can use the built-in Microsoft 365 content delivery network (CDN) to host static assets to provide better performance for your SharePoint Online pages. The Microsoft 365 CDN improves performance by caching static assets closer to the browsers requesting them, which helps to speed up downloads and reduce latency. Also, the Microsoft 365 CDN uses the HTTP/2 protocol for improved compression and HTTP pipelining. The Microsoft 365 CDN service is included as part of your SharePoint Online subscription.

## Microsoft SharePoint Online Management Shell

The Microsoft 365 CDN is managed by tenant administrators by using the Microsoft SharePoint Online Management Shell, a PowerShell module from Microsoft used to manage your SharePoint Online subscription in Office 365.

Before using any of the cmdlets in the Microsoft SharePoint Online Management Shell module, you must first connect to SharePoint Online using the Connect-SPOService cmdlet. All CDN settings are managed using the \*-SPOTenantCdn cmdlets.
