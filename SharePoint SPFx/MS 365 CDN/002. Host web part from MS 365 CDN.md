# Host web part from MS 365

## Review solution settings

Open package-solution.json from the config folder.
The package-solution.json file defines the package metadata as shown in the following code:

The default value for the includeClientSideAssets is true, which means that static assets are packaged automatically in the \*.sppkg files, and you don't need to separately host your assets from an external system.

Do not change this setting for this exercise, so that assets are automatically hosted when solution is deployed to your tenant.

If Microsoft 365 CDN is enabled, it's used automatically with default settings. If Microsoft 365 CDN isn't enabled, assets are served from the app catalog site collection. This means that if you leave the includeClientSideAssets setting true, your solution assets are automatically hosted in the tenant.

## Prepare web part assets to deploy

`gulp bundle --ship`

Execute the following task to bundle your solution. This executes a release build of your project by using a dynamic label as the host URL for your assets. This URL is automatically updated based on your tenant CDN settings.

`gulp package-solution --ship`

Execute the following task to package your solution. This creates an updated helloworld-webpart.sppkg package on the sharepoint/solution folder.

...

Once you have added the web part in any of your SharePoint site page

Open your browser's development tools and open the Sources tab.

Extend `publiccdn.sharepointonline.com` under the source and notice how the hello-world-web-part file is loaded from the Public CDN URL pointing dynamically to a library located under the app catalog site collection.
