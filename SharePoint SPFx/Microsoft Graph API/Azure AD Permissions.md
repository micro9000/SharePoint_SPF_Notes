It sounds like your SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web part is working locally or in development, but when deploying it to production via the **App Catalog**, you're not seeing the expected prompt to **approve Microsoft Graph API permissions**.

Let’s walk through the likely reasons this could be happening and how to fix it.

---

### ✅ **Checklist to Ensure Graph API Permission Approval Flow Works**

1. ### **Check that you added the correct Graph permission to `package-solution.json`**
    
    Your `package-solution.json` should include something like:

```json
{
  "solution": {
    "name": "your-solution-name",
    "id": "your-solution-id",
    "version": "1.0.0.0",
    "includeClientSideAssets": true,
    "isDomainIsolated": false,
    "webApiPermissionRequests": [
      {
        "resource": "Microsoft Graph",
        "scope": "User.Read"
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

    
    If **`webApiPermissionRequests`** is missing or incorrect, SharePoint won't request approval.
    
2. ### **Ensure `--ship` is used in all packaging steps**
    
    You've already done:
    

```bash
gulp build 
gulp bundle --ship 
gulp package-solution --ship
```

    
    ✅ So this step is good.
    
3. ### **Upload `.sppkg` file to the App Catalog Site**
    
    Make sure you are uploading the `.sppkg` file found in:

```sharepoint/solution/your-solution.sppkg`

    
4. ### **App Catalog Configuration**
    
    - When uploading the `.sppkg` file, you should be prompted with something like:
        
        > _"This solution requires new permissions. Approve or reject these permissions in the API Management page."_
        
    
    If **no prompt** appears, possible causes:
    
    - You **did not add** any permission (see Step 1).
        
    - You are **updating the same version number** — SharePoint may skip reprocessing. Bump the version in `package-solution.json`.
        
    - Your tenant admin previously **approved the required permission**, so there's nothing new to approve.
        
5. ### **Check the API Management Page**
    
    Go to your SharePoint Admin Center:
    
    - **https://<your-tenant>-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/online/AdminHome.aspx#/webApiPermissionManagement**
        
    
    There you can:
    
    - See **pending** Graph permission approvals.
        
    - Approve new ones if needed.
        
    - View **already approved** scopes like `User.Read`.

### ✅ Next Steps

Try the following:

1. **Update `package-solution.json` to include the correct permission** (`User.Read`).
    
2. **Bump the version** number of your solution to force SharePoint to reprocess it.
    
3. **Rebuild and repackage**:

```bash
gulp clean gulp 
build gulp bundle --ship 
gulp package-solution --ship
```

4. **Upload** the `.sppkg` file again to the **App Catalog**.
    
5. If still no prompt, **check the API Management page** — the permission might already be approved.
