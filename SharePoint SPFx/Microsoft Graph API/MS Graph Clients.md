In SPFx development which one should I use for microsoft graph client 

npm packages 
- @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client 
- @microsoft/sp-http

###### ChatGPT said:

In **SharePoint Framework (SPFx)** development, **you should use both**, but for **different purposes**:

---

### ✅ Use `@microsoft/sp-http` to get the Microsoft Graph Client:

This package is **SPFx-specific** and gives you access to the **context-aware** Microsoft Graph client. You typically use it like this:

ts

CopyEdit

`import { MSGraphClientV3 } from '@microsoft/sp-http';  this.context.msGraphClientFactory   .getClient('3')   .then((client: MSGraphClientV3) => {     return client       .api('/me')       .get()       .then((response) => {         console.log(response);       });   });`

- **Benefits**:
    
    - Handles **authentication** for you using the current user's context.
        
    - Automatically integrates with **SPFx permissions** model (`package-solution.json`).
        
    - Ensures requests are made using the right **Graph version**.
        

---

### ✅ Use `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client` only if:

- You’re **not in an SPFx context**, like in standalone Node.js apps or other frameworks.
    
- You need full control over authentication (e.g., using custom tokens, device code auth).
    
- You're building utilities or services outside SPFx that still call Microsoft Graph.
    

In SPFx, this package is **used under the hood** by `@microsoft/sp-http` when you call `msGraphClientFactory.getClient`.

### 💡 Summary:

|Scenario|Use `@microsoft/sp-http`|Use `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client`|
|---|---|---|
|SPFx Web Part / Extension|✅ Yes|❌ Not directly|
|External Node/React App|❌ No|✅ Yes|
|Handles SPFx auth automatically|✅ Yes|❌ No|

So for your SPFx project:

> ✅ **Use `@microsoft/sp-http` and its `msGraphClientFactory` to get the Graph client.**
